# im2stl

This simple project allows for easy conversion of RGB images into 3D prints that use backlight (like sunlight streaming in from a window) to display the image. The varying thickness achieved by layer height and slightly translucent filament enable this effect. Obviously, light-colored PLA is highly reccommended for these prints!
