# im2stl

This simple project allows for easy conversion of RGB images into 3D prints that use backlight (like sunlight streaming in from a window) to display the image. The varying thickness achieved by layer height and slightly translucent filament enable this effect. Obviously, light-colored PLA is highly reccommended for these prints!

My personal goal with this mini project was to write everything (e.g. the tessellation/triangulation of the mesh) from scratch in Python and get something printed on my new Bambu Labs P1S within a couple evenings. I had a blast putting this together and I'm pleasantly suprised by the final effect!
